# Data-Science-Project-1
This includes the files and code for my first project in my Principles of Data Science class. The goal of the project was to conduct analysis on datasets that included information about national parks all around the world. The goal of the project was to find a relationship between a predictor of our choosing and total animal population. Steps necessary for completing this project involved creating personalized tables with the data needed to conduct this analysis using SQL in a psql database as well as export/extract it as a .CSV. Once the file was extracted and created, I used R to conduct the data analysis creating the model and visualizations to help interpret the data and model better as well as gain some interesting insights.
